What's new in PSARCADE CLASSIC+
===============================
- This project is focused on merging the Arcade64 + HBMame system, a base system of a version 0.232 was used to update until 
  version 0.243, it will be the only version that will be published, since it is a collectible edition.

  The main thing of all has started a total cleaning in the roms sets eliminating hundreds of useless and unnecessary roms or 
  .chd, so that we can leave roms sets much lighter for our hard drive.
